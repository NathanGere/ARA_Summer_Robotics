<p>We will be starting off with what I researched and my final product.</p>
<p>The summer project I focused on was being able to detect a human and tell the stretch hello robot to stop moving and give the user what was being delivered</p>
<p>I was somewhat able to complete this code but not to its full potential. I can have the user control the robot and have it still detect a person</p>

<p>I used the following websites to help with my research!</p>
<p>Robot Github:<a href="https://docs.luxonis.com/en/latest/pages/troubleshooting/">Robot github</a></p>
<p>Camera Github:<a href="https://github.com/luxonis">Camera github</a></p>
