<p style="font-size: 25px; text-indent: 25px;">We will be starting off with what I researched and my final product. The summer project I focused on was being able to detect a human and tell the stretch hello robot to stop moving and give the user what was being delivered. I was somewhat able to complete this code but not to its full potential. I can have the user control the robot and have it still detect a person</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">I used the following websites to help with my research!</p>
<p style="font-size: 25px; text-indent: 1000px;">Robot Github:<a href="https://github.com/hello-robot">Robot github</a></p>
<p style="font-size: 25px; text-indent: 2500px;">Camera Github:<a href="https://github.com/luxonis">Camera github</a></p>
