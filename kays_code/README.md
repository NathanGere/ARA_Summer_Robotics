# Kay's Code
## Overview
The objective Kay was trying to reach was to create code that would cause the robot to not collide into obstacles using the lidar on the stretch robot.

There will also be a text file including all work done with the echo dot.

## collision_prevention_pkg
This package is currently able avoid obsticals using the lidar of the stretch robot. 

There is a python shell file for a client and a server that can be adjusted based on the application.

Using the current server the teleop twist python file provided by hello_robot was adjusted to help with collision prevention.

All default topics are for stretch robot in gazebo!
