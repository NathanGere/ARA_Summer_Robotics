# Kay's Code
## Overview
The objective Kay was trying to reach was to create code that would cause the robot to not
collide into obstacles using the lidar and the camera on the stretch robot.

## collision_prevention_pkg
This package is currently able avoid obsticals using the lidar of the stretch robot. The python
files in the package were created so that they can be easily changed based on the needs of those
using it. Also all of the topics used are for stretch robot in gazebo and need to be changed
if used for the physical robot.
